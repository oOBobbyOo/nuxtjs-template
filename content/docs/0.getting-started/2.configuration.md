# Configuration

By default, Nuxt is configured to cover most use cases. The [`nuxt.config.ts`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt.config) file can override or extend this default configuration.

## Nuxt Configuration

The [`nuxt.config.ts`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt.config) file is located at the root of a Nuxt project and can override or extend the application's behavior.

A minimal configuration file exports the `defineNuxtConfig` function containing an object with your configuration. The `defineNuxtConfig` helper is globally available without import.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // My Nuxt config
})
```
