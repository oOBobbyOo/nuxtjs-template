# Installation

Get started with Nuxt quickly with our online starters or start locally with your terminal.

Open a terminal (if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

```bash [npx]
npx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

```bash [bun]
bunx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
code <project-name>
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [pnpm]
# Make sure you have `shamefully-hoist=true` in `.npmrc` before running pnpm install
pnpm install
```

```bash [bun]
bun install
```

## Development Server

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode:

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev -o
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev -- -o
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev -o
```

```bash [bun]
bun run dev -o
```
